# Path Tracing an UGV with IMU feedback from APM module attached to Bot Body

Deviation in bot movement occur many times because of uneven distribution of weight on the bot, uneven distribution of power to the motors, friction, irregularities etc. Hence proper feedback is necessary. The current APM(fixed to the body), i.e. the bot orientation is sent to the controller every instant to see the current heading. A square is to be traced exactly which can be possible with good feedback. Bot moves fixed distance and if its orientation changes from the required orientation, it stops and corrects itself so as to not deviate from the required square.
